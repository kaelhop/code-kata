# Code Kata

## Description:

Went for minimizing the code. Had an idea as to what was needed to solve this one when I first saw the problem. It took about 30 to 45 min to write passing code then I went and minimized the code. 208 characters for the code. Excluded the new line character at the end of the file and removed it since it takes up a character and has no impact.

### Edit:
Thanks to jfine for posting his code I learned something new, was able to add the ability to chain the methods and also decrease the characters used to 200.

### Edit 2:
Managed to do some more research and fine a way to get it down to 198 characters.

### Edit 3:
'Zipped' to one less character: 197
